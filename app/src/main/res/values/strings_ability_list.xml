            In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn,
            you can enter a rage as a bonus action.
            While raging, you gain the following benefits if you
            aren’t wearing heavy armor:
            \n\n• You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength
            saving throws.
            \n\n• When you make a melee weapon attack using
            Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that
            increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown
            in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.
            \n\n• You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and
            slashing damage.
            \n\nIf you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or
            concentrate on them while raging.
            \n\nYour rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are
            knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you
            haven’t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn
            or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage
            on your turn as a bonus action.
            \n\nOnce you have raged the number of times shown
            for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the
            Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you
            can rage again.
        </item>
        <item>
            While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class
            equals <b>10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution
            modifier</b>.
            \n\nYou can use a shield and still gain this benefit.
        </item>
        <item>
            Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern
            for defense to attack with fierce desperation.
            \n\nWhen
            you make your first attack on your turn, you can decide
            to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you advantage on
            melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during this
            turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until
            your next turn.
        </item>
        <item>
            At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things
            nearby aren’t as they should be, giving you an edge
            when you dodge away from danger.
            \n\nYou have advantage on Dexterity saving throws
            against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells.
            To gain this benefit, you can’t be blinded, deafened, or
            incapacitated.
        </item>
        <item>
            By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have
            advantage on initiative rolls.
            Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of
            combat and aren’t incapacitated, you can act normally
            on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before
            doing anything else on that turn.
        </item>
        <item>
            Beginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional
            weapon damage die when determining the extra
            damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.
            \n\nThis increases to two additional dice at 13th level
            and three additional dice at 17th level.
        </item>
        <item>
            Starting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting
            despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points
            while you’re raging and don’t die outright, you can make
            a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed , you
            drop to 1 hit point instead.
            \n\nEach time you use this feature after the first, the DC
            in creases by 5. When you finish a short or long rest, the
            DC resets to 10.
        </item>
        <item>
            Beginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that
            it ends early only if you fall unconscious or if you
            choose to end it.
        </item>
        <item>
            Beginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength
            check is less than your Strength score, you can use that
            score in place of the total.
        </item>
        <item>
            At 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds. Your
            Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4. Your
            maximum for those scores is now 24.

    <string name="barbarianPrimalPath">
        Rage burns in every barbarian’s heart, a furnace
        that drives him or her toward greatness. Different
        barbarians attribute their rage to different sources,
        however. For some, it is an internal reservoir where
        pain, grief, and anger are forged into a fury hard as
        steel. Others see it as a spiritual blessing, a gift of
        a totem animal.

        \n\nAt 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of
        your rage. Choose the Path of the Berserker or the Path
        of the Totem Warrior. Your choice grants you features at 3rd
        level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.

            Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you
            can go into a frenzy when you rage. If you do so, for
            the duration of your rage you can make a single melee
            weapon attack as a bonus action on each of your turns
            after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one level
            of exhaustion.
        </item>
        <item>
            Beginning at 6th level, you can’t be charmed or
            frightened while raging. If you are charmed or
            frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is
            suspended for the duration of the rage.
        </item>
        <item>
            Beginning at 10th level, you can use your action to
            frighten someone with your menacing presence.
            When you do so, choose one creature that you can see
            within 30 feet of you.
            \nIf the creature can see or hear
            you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC
            equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma
            modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your
            next turn.
            \nOn subsequent turns, you can use your action
            to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened
            creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends
            if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more
            than 60 feet away from you.
            \nIf the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can\'t
            use this feature on that creature again for 24 hours.
        </item>
        <item>
            Starting at 14th level, when you take damage from
            a creature that is within 5 feet of you. you can use

            that creature.

            Yours is a path that seeks attunement with the natural
            world, giving you a kinship with beasts. At 3rd level when
            you adopt this path, you gain the ability to cast the beast
            sense and speak with animals spells, but only as rituals,
            as described in chapter 10.
        </item>
        <item>
            At 3rd level, w hen you adopt this path, you choose a
            totem spirit and gain its feature. You must make or
            acquire a physical totem object - an amulet or similar
            adornment — that in corporates fur or feathers, claws,
            teeth, or bones of the totem animal. At your option, you
            also gain minor physical attributes that are reminiscent
            of your totem spirit. For example, if you have a bear
            totem spirit, you might be unusually hairy and thick-
            skinned, or if your totem is the eagle, your eyes turn
            bright yellow.
            \n\nYour totem animal might be an animal related to those
            listed here but more appropriate to your homeland.
            /nFor exam ple, you could choose a hawk or vulture in
            place of an eagle.
            \n\n<b>Bear:</b> While raging, you have resistance to all damage
            except psychic damage. The spirit of the bear makes you
            tough enough to stand up to any punishment.
            \n\n<b>Eagle:</b> While you’re raging and aren’t wearing
            heavy armor, other creatures have disadvantage on
            opportunity attack rolls against you, and you can use the
            Dash action as a bonus action on your turn. The spirit
            of the eagle makes you into a predator who can weave
            through the fray with ease.
            \n\n<b>Wolf:</b> While you’re raging, your friends have
            advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature
            within 5 feet of you that is hostile to you. The spirit of
            the wolf makes you a leader of hunters.
        </item>
        <item>
            At 6th level, you gain a magical benefit based on the
            totem animal of your choice. You can choose the same
            animal you selected at 3rd level or a different one.
            \n\n<b>Bear:</b> You gain the might of a bear. Your carrying
            capacity (including maximum load and maximum lift)
            is doubled, and you have advantage on Strength checks
            made to push, pull, lift, or break objects.
            \n\n<b>Eagle:</b> You gain the eyesight of an eagle. You can
            see up to 1 mile away with no difficulty, able to discern
            even fine details as though looking at something no
            more than 100 feet away from you. Additionally, dim
            light doesn\'t impose disadvantage on your Wisdom
            (Perception) checks.
            \n\n<b>Wolf:</b> You gain the hunting sensibilities of a wolf. You
            can track other creatures while traveling at a fast pace,
            and you can move stealthily while traveling at a normal
            pace (see chapter 8 for rules on travel pace).
        </item>
        <item>
            At 10th level, you can cast the commune with nature
            spell, but only as a ritual. When you do so, a spiritual
            version of one of the animals you chose for Totem Spirit
            or Aspect of the Beast appears to you to convey the
            information you seek.
        </item>
        <item>
            At 14th level, you gain a magical benefit based on a
            totem animal of your choice. You can choose the same
            animal you selected previously or a different one.
            \n\n<b>Bear:</b> While you’re raging, any creature within 5 feet
            of you that’s hostile to you has disadvantage on attack
            rolls against targets other than you or another character
            with this feature. An enemy is immune to this effect if it
            can’t see or hear you or if it can’t be frightened.
            \n\n<b>Eagle:</b> While raging, you have a flying speed equal to
            your current walking speed. This benefit work s only in
            short bursts; you fall if you end your turn in the air and
            nothing else is holding you aloft.
            \n\n<b>Wolf:</b> While you\'re raging, you can use a bonus action
            on your turn to knock a Large or smaller creature prone
            when you hit it with melee weapon attack.

            You can inspire others through stirring words or music.
            To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose
            one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you
            who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic
            Inspiration die, a d6.
            \n\nOnce within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll
            the die and add the number rolled to one ability check,
            attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can
            wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the
            Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM
            says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic
            Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have
            only on e Bardic Inspiration die at a time.
            \n\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal
            to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You
            regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.
            \n\nYour Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach
            certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th
            level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th.

            Beginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or
            oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during
            a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can
            hear your performance regain hit points at the end of
            the short rest, each of those creatures regains an extra
            1d6 hit points.
            \n\nThe extra hit points increase when you reach certain
            levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th
            level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.

            make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.
            \n\nAt 10th level, you can choose another two skill
            proficiencies to gain this benefit.
        </item>
        <item>
            Beginning when you reach 5th level, you regain all of
            your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration w hen you
            finish a short or long rest.
        </item>
        <item>
             At 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or
            words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. As
            an action, you can start a performance that lasts until
            the end of your next turn. During that time, you and any
            friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage
            on saving throws against being frightened or charmed.
            A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit.
            The performance ends early if you are incapacitated or
            silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required).

            By 10th level, you have plundered magical knowledge
            from a wide spectrum of disciplines. Choose two spells
            from any class, including this one. A spell you choose
            must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard
            table, or a cantrip.
            \n\nThe chosen spells count as bard spells for you and are
            included in the number in the Spells Known column of

            Also at 3rd level, you learn how to use your wit to
            distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and
            competence of others. When a creature that you can
            see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability

            check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its
            damage. The creature is immune if it can’t hear you or if
            it’s immune to being charmed.

            At 6th level, you learn two spells of your choice from any
            class. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast,
            as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip. The chosen
            spells count as bard spells for you but don’t count
            against the number of bard spells you know.
        </item>
        <item>
            Starting at 14th level, when you make an ability check,
            you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration. Roll a
            Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to
            your ability check. You can choose to do so after you roll
            the die for the ability check, but before the DM tells you
            whether you succeed or fail.

            gain proficiency with medium armor, shields, and
            martial weapons.
        </item>
        <item>
            Also at 3rd level, you learn to inspire others in battle.
            A creature that has a Bardic Inspiration die from you
            can roll that die and add the number rolled to a weapon
            damage roll it just made.
            \n\nAlternatively, when an attack
            roll is made against the creature, it can use its reaction
            to roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number
            rolled to its AC against that attack, after seeing the roll
            but before knowing whether it hits or misses.

        <item>
            Starting at 6th level, you can attack twice, instead of

        <item>
            At 14th level, you have mastered the art of weaving
            spellcasting and weapon use into a single harmonious
            act. When you use your action to cast a bard spell, you
            can make one weap on attack as a bonus action.

            At 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine
            energy directly from your deity, using that energy to fuel
            magical effects. You start with two such effects: Turn
            Undead and an effect determined by your domain. Some
            domains grant you additional effects as you advance in
            levels, as noted in the domain description.
            \n\nWhen you use your Channel Divinity, you choose
            which effect to create. You must then finish a short or
            long rest to use your Channel Divinity again.
            \n\nSome Channel Divinity effects require saving throws.
            When you use such an effect from this class, the DC
            equals your cleric spell save DC.
            \n\nBeginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel
            Divinity twice between rests, and beginning at 18th level.
            you can use it three times between rests. When you finish
            a short or long rest, you regain your expended uses.
        </item>
        <item>
            As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a
            prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see
            or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom
            saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is
            turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.
            \n\nA turned creature must spend its turns trying to move
            as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly
            move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take
            reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action
            or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from
            moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use
            the Dodge action.
        </item>
        <item>
            Starting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving
            throw against your Turn Undead feature, the creature is
            instantly destroyed if its challenge rating is at or below a
            certain threshold, as shown in the table below.

            Beginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to
            intervene on your behalf when your need is great.
            \n\nImploring your deity’s aid requires you to use your
            action. Describe the assistance you seek, and roll
            percentile dice. If you roll a number equal to or lower
            than your cleric level, your deity intervenes. The DM
            chooses the nature of the intervention; the effect of any
            cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be appropriate.
            \n\nIf your deity intervenes, you can’t use this feature
            again for 7 days. Otherwise, you can use it again after
            you finish a long rest.
            \n\nAt 20th level, your call for intervention succeeds
            automatically, no roll required.

    <string name="clericDivineDomainsTitle">
        Divine Domains
    </string>

    <string name="clericDivineDomainsDescription">
         In a pantheon, every deity has influence over different
        aspects of mortal life and civilization, called a deity’s
        domain. All the domains over which a deity has
        influence are called the deity’s portfolio. For example,
        the portfolio of the Greek god Apollo includes the
        domains of Know ledge, Life, and Light. As a cleric, you
        choose one aspect of your deity’s portfolio to emphasize,
        and you are granted powers related to that domain.

        \n\nYour choice might correspond to a particular sect
        dedicated to your deity. Apollo, for example, could be
        worshiped in one region as Phoebus (“radiant”). Apollo,
        emphasizing his influence over the Light domain,
        and in a different place as Apollo Acesius (“healing”),
        emphasizing his association with the Life domain.
        Alternatively, your choice of domain could simply be a
        matter of personal preference, the aspect of the deity
        that appeals to you most.

        \n\nEach domain’s description gives examples of deities
        who have influence over that domain. Gods are included
        from the worlds of the Forgotten Realms, Greyhawk,
        Dragon lance, and Eberron campaign settings, as well as
        from the Celtic, Greek, Norse, and Egyptian pantheons
        of antiquity.

        \n\nChoose one domain related to your deity: Knowledge,
        Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, or War. Each
        domain is detailed at the end of the class description,
        and each one provides examples of gods associated
        with it. Your choice grants you domain spells and other
        features when you choose it at 1st level. It also grants
        you additional ways to use Channel Divinity when you
        gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional benefits at
        6th, 8th, and 17th levels.
        \n\n

        Each domain has a list of spells—its domain spells—
        that you gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain
        description. Once you gain a domain spell, you always
        have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the
        number of spells you can prepare each day.
        If you have a domain spell that doesn’t appear on the
        cleric spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.

            At 1st level, you learn two languages of your choice.
            You also become proficient in your choice of two of the
            follow in gskills: Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion.
            \n\nYour proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check
            you make that uses either of those skills.

        <item>
            Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity
            to tap into a divine well of knowledge. As an action,
            you choose one skill or tool. For 10 minutes, you have
            proficiency with the chosen skill or tool.
        </item>
        <item>
            At 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity to read a
            creature’s thoughts. You can then use your access to the
            creature’s mind to command it.
            \n\nAs an action, choose one creature that you can see
            within 60 feet of you. That creature must make a
            Wisdom saving throw. If the creature succeeds on the
            saving throw, you can’t use this feature on it again until
            you finish a long rest.
            \n\nIf the creature fails its save, you can read its surface
            thoughts (those foremost in its mind, reflecting its
            current emotions and what it is actively thinking
            about) when it is within 60 feet of you. This effect lasts
            for 1 minute.
            \n\nDuring that time, you can use your action to end this
            effect and cast the suggestion spell on the creature
            without expending a spell slot. The target automatically
            fails its saving throw against the spell.

        <item>
            Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to

            Starting at 17th level, you can call up visions of the
            past that relate to an object you hold or your immediate
            surroundings. You spend at least 1 minute in meditation
            and prayer, then receive dream like, shadowy glimpses
            of recent events. You can meditate in this way for a
            number of minutes equal to your Wisdom score and
            must maintain concentration during that time, as if you
            were casting a spell.
            \n\nOnce you use this feature, you can’t use it again until
            you finish a short or long rest.
            \n\n<b>Object Reading.</b> Holding an object as you meditate,
            you can see visions of the object’s previous owner.
            After meditating for 1 minute, you learn how the owner
            acquired and lost the object, as well as the most recent
            significant event involving the object and that owner.
            If the object was owned by another creature in the
            recent past (within a number of days equal to your
            Wisdom score), you can spend 1 additional minute
            for each owner to learn the same information about
            that creature.
            \n\n<b>Area Reading.</b> As you meditate, you see visions
            of recent events in your immediate vicinity (a room ,
            street, tunnel, clearing, or the like, up to a 50-foot cube),
            going back a number of days equal to your Wisdom
            score. For each minute you meditate, you learn about
            one significant event, beginning with the most recent.
            Significant events typically involve powerful emotions,
            such as battles and betrayals, marriages and murders,
            births and funerals. However, they might also include
            more mundane events that are nevertheless important
            in your current situation.

            When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor.
        </item>
        <item>
            Also starting at 1st level, your healing spells are more
            effective. Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher
            to restore hit points to a creature, the creature regains
            additional hit points equal to 2+ the spell’s level.
        </item>
        <item>
            Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity
            to heal the badly injured.
            \n\nAs an action, you present your holy symbol and
            evoke healing energy that can restore a number of hit
            points equal to five times your cleric level. Choose any
            creatures within 30 feet of you, and divide those hit
            points among them. This feature can restore a creature
            to no more than half of its hit point maximum . You can’t
            use this feature on an undead or a construct.
        </item>
        <item>
            Beginning at 6th level, the healing spells you cast on
            others heal you as well. When you cast a spell of 1st
            level or higher that restores hit points to a creature
            other than you, you regain hit points equal to 2+ the
            spell’s level.
        </item>
        <item>
            At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon
            strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns
            when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can
            cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage to
            the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage
            in creases to 2d8.
        </item>
        <item>
            Starting at 17th level, when you would normally roll
            one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell, you
            instead use the highest number possible for each die.
            For example, instead of restoring 2d6 hit points to a
            creature, you restore 12.

            Also at 1st level, you can interpose divine light between
            yourself and an attacking enemy. When you are attacked
            by a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see,
            you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on
            the attack roll, causing light to flare before the attacker
            before it hits or misses. An attacker that can’t be blinded
            is immune to this feature.
            \n\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to
            your Wisdom modifier (a minim um of once). You regain
            all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

            you must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature
            takes radiant damage equal to 2d10 + your cleric level
            on a failed saving throw, and half as much damage on a
            successful one. A creature that has total cover from you

            enemies in the bright light have disadvantage on saving
            throws against any spell that deals fire or radiant damage.
